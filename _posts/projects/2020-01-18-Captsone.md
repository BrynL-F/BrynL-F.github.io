title: Facial Detection Security System
title-sentence: The capstone project made to protect property
---
During spring 2020, I, Jessica D’Cunha, Tymoore Jamal Dorsa Nahid came together for our capstone project to deliver an accurate and reliable facial detection security system that allows a property owner to have confidence in their safety and privacy.

Our project’s primary goal is to meet a property owner’s need for accurate, reliable, and timely property monitoring. Secondary goals include building the product with safe and easily sourceable materials that have minimal negative effects on the environment and developing portable and maintainable software for the product that can be easily expanded upon in the future. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
A main project area is Machine Learning and Privacy. Machine learning provides a face detection solution that performs quick face detection while maintaining accurate and reliable results. While our focus on privacy ensures that users have a meaningful system that they can trust and feel safe using.

    <p>Creating and Using our Machine Learning Model</p>
    <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
The primary features of our project include face detection, informing users of break-ins, allowing users to control the camera, and storing images of any intruders. Face detection was performed through feeding recorded images into a trained machine learning classification model which we trained using thousands of faces. User control and accessibility are managed through an Android application that users can use to view alarms and intrusions, as well as view a live feed where users can monitor their property in real-time while having the ability to modify the orientation of the camera remotely. Data communication, storage, and notification management are all performed through a secure cloud-based database service named Firebase.

    <p>System Design</p>
    <br>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Our design uses many features offered through a Raspberry Pi. All peripherals, such as motion detectors, motors, and cameras are connected directly to the Raspberry Pi which interfaces to our Firebase database and Android application. Our project has also utilized Raspberry Pi hotspot capabilities, as we use the Raspberry Pi hotspot to perform all local communication between the user and the Raspberry Pi, this includes initially connecting a user to the Raspberry Pi as well as connecting the Raspberry Pi to WIFI. Our design also uses many features offered through Firebase. Our Firebase server liaises between the Raspberry Pi and the user application while also acting as a real-time database, secure login manager, and notifications service. Our android application uses encrypted file storage as well as a connection to Firebase to display a live feed, control the orientation of the camera, manage user contacts to act in case of an emergency, and store private information such as photos of the user’s property during intrusions.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Overall, we were able to accomplish the project requirements and created a secure, accurate, and fast security system. The system is secure; 100% of our communication with Firebase is AES-256 encrypted through Firebase and all images are AES-256 encrypted through the Android Application. The system is accurate; our face detection machine learning model has an accuracy of 97.7%. The system is fast; users are informed in real-time of an intrusion and are able to view and control a live feed of their property.

All of our hardware materials were acceptably safe to acquire and use, with no negative effects other than the 35kW and 22.9 grams of carbon per year. The main hardware element that we made was a PCB board that connected our Raspberry Pi GPIO with our three HC-SR501 motion detectors, our two SG990 Servo Motors for camera orientation control.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Our project advances current state-of-the-art technology by demonstrating how Machine Learning can be paired with widely available and popular technologies to create an accurate, secure, fast, and reliable system. The Facial Detection Security System shows how machine learning can be added to a traditionally manual system to increase accuracy and ease of use. We are very excited that our project combines emergent technologies like cloud services, deep learning, and new encryption techniques in a scalable way.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Having had success in meeting the vast majority of the user, builder, and developer needs of our project, we look forward to exploring future expansions; next steps involve incorporating the PCB board design for our peripherals, creating more CNN models and moving them to a higher-tiered Firebase for increased accuracy and speed, and creating a 3D printed case for our project. Future research could focus on fine-tuning our machine learning models and using motion and shape detection to allow the security camera to track human movements to provide more visibility of break-ins to users.
