title-sentence: As part of the World's Challenge Challenge, we created a sustainable sanitary health tool for young women in rural india
---
From September 2018 - March 2019, I worked with Simran Gulati and Christina Luo in the World's Challenge Challenge (WCC) at the University of Alberta to create an idea, business, or product that would help the world achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Before the WCC, Simran Gulate and I both had opportunities to meet young women in their communities in South Asia, and learn about their health, practices, and sanitation, specifically around menstrual health. We realized that methods for managing menstrual health and education were not up to par, leaving millions of young women at a disadvantage. [According to Swasth News](https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/23-million-women-drop-out-of-school-every-year-when-they-start-menstruating-in-india-17838/), each year in India, 23 million girls drop out of school when they start menstruating. This has a huge effect on young women, contributing in part to a 16% differnce in literacy between genders (male literacy: 80.9% compared to female literacy: 64.6%), [as shown through India's Census](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0049085715618558#:~:text=According%20to%20the%202011%20Census,country's%20population%20is%20still%20illiterate.). Menstrual hygiene challenges exist outside of India, in each nation.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Christina Luo, Simran Gulati and decided that this was a major area of need, and determined that we would like to contribute to positive change around menstrual hygiene in the WCC competition. Of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals that WCC focused on, we decided to focus on four: Good Health and Well-Being, Gender Equality, Clean Water and Sanitation, and Responsible Consumption and Production. We focused on the Punjab in Northern India, since we had partners in various volunteer organizations in that district that could connect us with young women.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Personas and Problem</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
We had a set of personas to represent our users: different categories of women and young girls facing problems relating to menstruation. The user base we chose to focus on is young women who are in school who are about to start their periods, or have just started. Most young girls would be in school and looking for menstruation solutions at this tiem. We decided to start small with a small user base, close to our current connections: these users are all from Punjab and who faced problems relating to menstrual hygiene that holds them back from participating in their communities and maintaining good health. The three main problems these young women were facing that we found were the affordability of menstrual products, a lack of knowledge around safely and correctly using and cleaning menstrual products, and their communities' and schools' reluctance to discuss feminine hygiene.

<h2>Research and Brainstorming</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
After coming to understand the personas of the young women we were targetting as well as their problems through our contacts in Punjab, we needed to create a solution. Would an educational program, a support organization, hygienic washroom additions, or educational materials meet our users' needs the most comprehensively? In the end, we found that a combination of educational materials and a menstrual product would address the users' needs. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Our next step was conducting research into what products and information our users would need. Most users would not be interested in less traditional menstruation producst, such as cups, or tampons; or for heavier menstruation, IUDs, or birth control pills. We were informed that "...[the] myth about Tampons is that they 'Break Virginity' and/or that they are used by 'Bad Mannered girls'." This view applied to menstrual products internal to the body.  Additionally, most of these products were prohibitively expensive, with a high upfront cost (IUDs, cups, birth control) or a high ongoing cost (tampons). Single use menstrual pads (most western pads) are also expensive over time, requiring at least fifteen in one month. A cheap, external pad was our only option.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
We discovered that women in developing nations often use reusable pads or fabric swatches because of their absorbative properties. A common difficulty for women who use reusable pads is that they often need to wash these by hand in privacy, and hang dry them away from others' eyes due to a cultural belief in covertness around feminine hygiene. This is difficult for women and young women, since they do not want others to find their drying pads, and want to be alone while washing them. At home, they do not want their pads to be found and recognized for what they are, and at school, there are often no private washrooms or private places to change, wash, and dry their menstrual pads.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
We needed a way to covertly change a reusable pad, wash it, and dry it while allowing these users to feel diginified and clean. Through rounds of brainstorming, we came up with our first prototype: a menstration kit called the Asha Kit. After doing further market research, we found that our prototype was similar to existing kits, and piggy backed off of existing products to create a more tailored product. Our menstruation kit would include reusable pads, underwear, soap, a leak-free pouch, and an informational brochure. Our kit would be both reusable and affordable, unlike competitors, and it would also meet specific needs of our users.

<h2>Prototyping</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Each item in the kit is specifically made to address a pressing need. The reusable pads did not look like a traditional pad, but instead it was a folded swatch of absorptive fabric that could be washed by hand, and hung to dry while seeming like an ordinary cloth. It could then be hung outside, where UV light from the sun could reduce harmful bacteria on the pad cloth, further protecting the users. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
This reusable pad cloth would fit into the pair of underwear included in the pack, fitting  under two tabs built into the underwear gusset (with the gusset being the pocket of fabric in the crotch of women's underwear). In this way, no hard or uncomfortable elements (buttons, snaps, velcro) would hinder the users, and users could replace the absorptive pad quickly and providing a cheap and effective way to hold the reusable absorptive fabric in place. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The leak free pouch would be used to store used and unused cloths in two separate pockets. Like other forms of menstrual products, the pad cloth would need to be replaced many times a day. By having a subtle, clean, leak-free, scent-free place to store used and unused pads, girls and women will be able to stay out and about (at school, at work) until they run out of reusable pads. The travel-sized pouch allows the users to continue learning or working for at least a full day, compared to a few hours had they not had a place to store the used pad other than in privacy at home. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
A typical bar of soap would be included to facilitate sanitation. The informational brochure would include information on basic feminine anatomy, menstrual health, menstrual hygiene, and how to change and clean the elements in their kit. The brochure would include information in the differenct dialects of the region, and many diagrams so that its information is accessible to all readers and viewers.

Unfortunately, we did not have the capital to iterate and test these prototypes with the women and young women of Punjab.
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Business Model</h2>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
We needed a business model in order to create and distribute our kits. We cut costs until we calulated that a kit (with five pad cloths, 3 pairs of underwear, 1 bar of soap, 1 leak-proof pouch, and 1 brochure) would cost us just under $7.50 CAD per kit, using local soap makers, print shops, and seamstresses. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
We quickly realized that our user is not our customer. Our users are young girls who are in the beginning stages of menstruation. These girls don't have the money, nor the family influence to be able to purchase their own kits. We determined that most family members would not be willing to pay for our kits, despite its affordability. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
To create capital, we would use a buy-one donate-one model where once a person purchases a kit for themselves, another kit would go to a girl in need, similar to the model used by Toms Shoes. Urban Indian girls are typically more affluent than rural community members, and yet still are subject to menstruation. Our kits would be made available through a neighbours helping neighbours model, where a girl or family in urban indian cities would purchase a kit online, leading to the distribution of a kit through our current partner volunteer organizations (Rotary International, Roteract Club) and employees stationed at rural schools.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
With a budget of $10,000 CAD, as established by the WCC competition, a rough estimation of four months of our business start up and operational costs is below. 
Item | Cost ($ CAD)
------------ | -------------
Business Registration with Indian Government: 15,000 Rs &nbsp;| $287.54
Taxes: 30% of profit | $200
Laptop and Phone costs | $840
Website | $26.22
Advertising | $551.97
Worker Transport | $500
Salary (office worker and 2 tailors) | $2,595
Translator for 100 hours : $5.75*100 | $575
Prototypes (75) | $750
500 kits: $7.50*500 | $3,750
Buffer | $604.13

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
In order to get this social enterprise off and rolling, we would proceed in four stages. The first stage for the first four weeks involves legally setting up the business, sourcing employees, and forging business and charity relationships. By the end of the next stage, 8 weeks in, we would have a digital storefront set up, as well as finished our rounds of prototyping, leaving us confident enough to proceed to stage 3, 4 months in. By this stage, we will have double our output of kits and buyers. By the time the year is out, we will have reached our final stage where we continue to expand, sell kits, and use key indicators to iterate to find new ways to meet our users' needs.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
We presented our social enterprise and were advanced to second place in the University of Alberta, receiving $11,250 to be used towards international studies. This process was humbling, instructive and empowering, and I look forward to eventually implementing this project or a similar one in the future.
