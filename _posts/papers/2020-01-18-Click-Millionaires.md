title-sentence: A review of Scott Fox's "Work Less, Live More with an Internet Business You Love" methodology
---

Published in 2012, "Click Millionaires" the how-to book by e-commerce expert Scott Fox describes the stories and strategies of eight successful entrepreneurs who moved from the traditional 9-5 work place to an online, flexible work week.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I found this on a 'Best Online Business Books' by Forbes when looking for specific strategies and tips on how to start and lead a succcessful online business. I'll be sharing the most meaningful ideas from this book.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Fox shares his srategies in Seven Parts.
Part 1 - Identify the lifestyle goals you want
Part 2 - Discover revolutionary 'Click Millionaire' principles
Part 3 & 4 - Learn about eight example entrepreneurs
Part 5 - Find a niche business model that meets your needs and uses your skills
Part 6 - Learn the easiest ways to create an monetize a website
Part 7 - Create an action plan

Part 1 - Identify the lifestyle goals you want
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 />
Fox defines a Liftestyle Business as a real business 'where you prioritize lifestyle benefits over growth and profits'/[Page 13/]. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
He also defines a click millionare as a business owner who 'uses websites, e-commercce, digital publishing, and social media to build lifestyle businesses that share their ideas and products with the world ... on their own terms'[ page 15]. It's important to note that a click millionaire is not necessarily a millionaire, but instead someone who is rich in choice and values personal freedom.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Fox explains that a lifestyle goal you should strive for is a balance between profit and passion., emphasizing the need for financial freedom as well as creative freedom.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Using the idea of investing your time instead of spending it, Fox introduces having an investment mindset, suggesting readers choose to pursue profit and passion.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Three questions are suggested for the readers' consideration on page 26:
 - How do you want to spend your days?
 - What do you most like to do?
 - What kind of contribution do you want to make in the world?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Click Millionaire Design Exercises [Page 32]:
 - What would your ideal Click Millionaire lifestyle look like if you :made it" running your own business?
 - What changes would you want to make to your current life to get there?
 - What are you happy with today and what would you like to upgrade?
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Fox then encourages us to use our answers to distill our priorities.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The next step is getting involved in areas of interest around you (mostly online). Fox suggests using a notebook to jot down good and bad ideas as they come.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

An intriguing question posed on page 35 as part of the design exercise is 'If 1,000 fans were paying me $100 each annually, what would I do for them?".
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Reading his suggestions for lifestyle goals, I realize I might be too easygoing. I have lofty career goals, but I am extremely adaptable in how I get there as well as how my goals affect my personal life, and find it hard to pinpoint preferences.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

A personal action plan is the final step in the design exercise, suggesting 4 main steps on page 40.
1 - Brainstorm by creating 20 likes and 20 dislikes life and work experiences that can be changed.
2 - Priorize these to show rank/preference/importance.
3 - Knock off the bottom 10
4 - Sleep on it and revisit it the next day or week with changes and tweaks
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Part 2 - Lifestyle Business Principles
<p>&nbsp;</p>

A basic principle shared is that content/good creates customers, which creates money, and that there are kinds of goods: physical (think amazon), digital (think ebooks or software), or advertising.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Fox suggests a 4-step process to create a new market:
1 - Find an underserved niche, where users are looking for your solutions/products/content
2 - Spread your brand. Develop an audience first, monetizing later
3 - Reguarly create attractive content
4 - Offer solutions to your audiences' problems
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Four Principles of Click Millionaires:
1 - Help People. "The best place to start a business is where people need help" [Page 49]. Make sure there is a need for you and your business
2 - Expert Credibility. People prefer experts, so find a way to represent yourself in a way that gains their trust and respect
3/4 - Automation & Outsourcing. Get someone or something else to do tasks if your time is worth more.
5 - Audience Content Creation. Let users create content
6 - Scalability. Make sure your business has structures that support growth
7 - Recurring Revenue. Draw out payments so that they pay less upfront, but more over time.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

How to be viewed as an expert (Page 58):
 - Offer advice that is authentic and will actually help people
 - Offer solutions, not advice. Make sure it's specialized
 - Deliver expertise in an engaging way (social media)
 - Your expertise doesn't have to be unique, but it should be personalized.
 - Your Intellectual Property makes you an expert
 - Your content is the focus, not your expertness
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 What should be on an About Us page (Page 66):
 - Quick summary of services and the value you provide
 - short mission statement or explanation of why you are in this business
 - contact info
 - photos of workers/you
<p>&nbsp;</p>


The click millionaires shows 10 steps to become an expert:
 1) Identify a niche of interest to you and others
 2) Buy a domain name
 3) Set up a Blog (wordpress, wix, weebly)
 4) Make a user name that matches the domain name you purchased
 5) Set up google alerts to get updates on products, ideas, companies that are valuable to your target market
 6) Plublish short summaires of artilcles and blogs that google alert sends you to your blog
 7) Demonstrate expertise and gather content (comments) from user audience
 8) Reach out to 20 people that the target community is interested in, and invite them to get involved (read, comment) on your blog posts
 9) Repeat the previous three steps
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Part 3 - 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 There are multiple ways to publish digitally including (page 75-76):
 -email newsletters
 -blogs
 -podcasts
 -videos
 -online promotion businesses
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Together or alone, these can be part of a digital magazine that readers would be interested in.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 There are free elements to include when 'publishing' your magazine, including(from page 77):
-links to blog posts of others
-press releases of different companies
-short summaries of news stories published by others
-guest posts from experts, industry executives, or advertisers
-photos from the audience
-event listings
-job openinings
<p>&nbsp;</p>

You can provide value to your users by preventing them form feeling bombarded by information. Much like a newspaper only tells you of some events, your blog or 'online magazine' sends digestible amounts of information to users, allowing them to learn more without drowning.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

There are two kinds of publications you can use to connect with the two kinds of audiences: consumer and business.
-A B2B (business to business) trade publication, or
-A B2C (business to consumer) entertainment and consumer publication.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Email Newsletters:
Click Millionaires explores two examples of people who used email newsletters (or noozles) to build a business: Al Peterson and Randy Cassingham who made B2B and B2C email newsletters, respectively.
Al made a talk show news newsletter, while Randy quit his job at NASA to publish 'weird but true' stories. 
They make their money through two methods: advertisements (for free newsletters), and subscriptions that are ad-free.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

To start a newsletter, you will need to find an email service provider, like MailChimp, AWeber, or FeedBlitz.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Blogs: 
You can make money by advertising on the sites (google Adsense), selling subscriptions, creating and selling books from blog contenct, or selling the blog.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Quick steps for building your first blog:
1) Pick a blog-hosting service (wordpress, teyppad, blooger, Tumblr)
2) Choose a domain nam. Make it short, memorable, easy to spell, and has the .com extension
3) Optimize your site for SEO, so that your content will be surfaced more often by the users you are targetting
4) Develop an off-site markeeting plan. Consider how you can get users to find and use your blog.
5) Install adsnese, Google's pay-per-click advertising program.
6) Collect email addresses to create an email list so that you can market to your users.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

On page 101, Fox recommends publishing "one short article per month or 10 long articles daily", but he really just means that you should publish regularly and that your users will understand that a long article will take more time.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

If you don't like writing, the following strategies are suggested:
<p>&nbsp;</p>

1) Recruit friends and industry contacts to write as guest bloggeres
-Repost free articles from article banks, giving credit where it is due
-Interview poeple or review products, reducing the quantity of original content
-Review or summarize instead of creating
<p>&nbsp;</p>


Audio Opportunities: Podcasts and Internet Radio Star
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Betty from the "Betty in the Sky with a Suitcase" podcast about her work as a flight attendant is used as another Click Millionaire example. Now, around 20,000 people tune in for each episode.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Ways to make money as a podcaster:
-affiliate ads (Amazon)
-episode or show sponsorships
-online store
-royalties from books
<p>&nbsp;</p>


Starting:
-Get a recording tool. There are free ones, like Audacit.
-You could buy recording equipment, but these days recording equipment in your phone, headphones, or laptop is up to sunff.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Fox recommends submitting podcasts to iTunes, being the largest directory of podcasts. He also recommends RadioGuestList.com, which allows you quickly and easily find relevant people to brind into your podcasts.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Making your own web TV Show
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Tools include YouTube, Ustream, Livestream, Skype, or Google+. Fox interviews Dave Powers who uses YouTube share his passion about remote controlled airplanes. With 100,000 views a day on his youtube channel, he makes several thousand dollars from YouTube ads every month. He directs those viewers to an online course he made, as well as selling digital products promoted by his videos.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

To make money
- have ads on YouTube
- recommend products or sites on your videos
<p>&nbsp;</p>

To create a video show:
- create a free YouTube account
- use a basic digital camera and your computer to film yourself or your screen
- make sure your lighting is good
- you can find free or paid software tools to edit the footage
- or find a qualified video editor on Elance, Guru, or Craigslist.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Social Networking Communities:
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Create a forum or community site for like minded people to share content and discuss within.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

To succeed, social networking communities need to:
-serve specific niche needs
-focus on helping members
-don't spend money on marketing
<p>&nbsp;</p>

To make money:
-ads
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Basic platforms:
-Ning
-SubHub
-SocialGo
-MemberGate
-WildApricot
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Digital Downloadable Content
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Some digital files to sell as downloads:
- documents
- music
- recipes
- patterns
- e-books
- instruction guides
- videos
- drawings
- photographs
- software programs
- diagrams
<p>&nbsp;</p>

To succeed in selling these digital products:
1) serve needs and solve problems
2) understand that your product is low cost, and can provide big returns. Capitilize on this gap.
3) people pay for instant gratification, or convenience.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

To get started
1) Create a file that has useful content
2) Set up an e-commerce platform on your website. Like, e-Junkie, Payloadz, or ClickBank.
3) Upload your content to your website
4) Market your product
<p>&nbsp;</p>


Part 4 - When you don't have your own product
<p>&nbsp;</p>

There are many ways to generate money and value without having your own product.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

These include:
-Online Promotion Services
-Reviews
-Interviews
-Affiliate Marketing
-Flash Sales and Daily Deals
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Online Promotion Services: Create a platform (social media, website, blog) to promote a sponsor's product every day
The trick: finding a way to get people to listen (free giveaways, popularity, etc.)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Reviews: review products or digitial services
The trick: make it niche
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Interviews: usually a video or audio track interviewing high-profile, knowledgeable or entertaining people.
The trick: leverage your network and make sure your questions are unique and helpful
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Affiliate marketing: getting a portion of the sales from a sponsor of something you advertise.
The trick: make it relevant to users, pick things that you would use
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Flash Sales and Daily Deals: make a site that collects and displays sales information. Pair this with affiliate marketing, and you've got yourself a cash cow.
The trick: find an undersupplied market
<p>&nbsp;</p>



Freelancing as a Design Strategy
<p>&nbsp;</p>

As a freelancer, you take on work that you want. It is less of a leadership role, but still allows you freedom over your own work and lifestyle.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

To find work as a freelancer, use:
-oDesk.com
-freelancer.com
-elance.com
-Guru.com
-HireMyMom.com
<p>&nbsp;</p>


Part 5 - Finding your eNiche
<p>&nbsp;</p>

A niche is more than a market. There is a hierarchy that you can capitilize on at any level. The top most level has the most customers, but is the hardest to get into. The lower levels are the easiest to join, but have less of an audience (though still large).
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Major Market > Market > Sub Market > Niche > Sub Niche
<p>&nbsp;</p>

For example (Page 194):
Aerospace > Airplanes > Jets > Jet Air Shows > Jet Air Show Staff
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Aim to work within Sub Niches or Niches and expand over time upwards or outwards. "Start by focusing on your most likely path for generating revenue soonest..." (Page 195)
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The Click Millionaires Niche Identification Method
<p>&nbsp;</p>

1) Choose one P as the foundation of your business. 
    - Passion (hobby, issue, or industry that you want to explore)
    - People (education, area, interests, spirituality, etc. that a group of people share)
    - Problem (needs, inefficiences, inconveniences you see in you life to seek to correct)
    - Product (digital, tool, entertainment, etc. that people would use)
    Brainstorm ideas
2) Audience Needs Analysis
    - Ask what your audience's needs, problems, pain points, and desires are. Write them down and compare with your brainstormed ideas to see where these needs have gone unmet.
3) Profit Potential
    - Evaluate your target marekt's size and the purchasing power of your target audience. Will they pay money for this product? How much will they spend?
4) Competitors Analysis
    - Don't reinvent the wheel: share generic ideas that work well and learn from more experienced entrepreneurs.
5) Format and Distribution Analysis:
    - Make your your format is the best way to reach your audience
    - Some example formats include blogs, forums, noozles, podcasts, videos, teleseminars, and mobile apps
6) Product Development:
    - create and crystallize a few different ideas (or products)
7) Operations and Production Cost Analysis (Page 202):
    - How much of your time and money will your new venture take to start?
    - What are the recurring operating costs?
    - Does the website, content, marketing, or product need regular updating?
    - How much of the production can be automated with Software?
    - Can you hire people to replace yourself or does the operation require your personal involvement?
    - Can you design the business so that the audience contribues as much of the content as possible?
    - If the business starts to succeed, will it scale by itself or require additional resources of time or money to serve more customers?
    - Will growth increase profitability or hurt it?
8) Marketing Analysis
    - Look at competitors' marketing strategies and identify holes
9) Think and decide for yourself
    - Make the final call on what ideas to pursue and how
<p>&nbsp;</p>


Testing Customer Demand
<p>&nbsp;</p>

It is always better to test your product before trying to perfect it. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

To do this:
- validate your ideas by talking to potential customers, not friends and family. Go to an online forum or make cold calls
- run an online survey or poll that you can spread in your network or pay to spread in niches using Facebook, Twitter, or other social media platforms
- validate via an online keyword search. Google AdWords' keyword tool is free and will show you the number of searches for those keywords
- get feedback on your site. You can use usertesting.com, usabilityhub.com, fivesecondtest.com and usabilla.com, as well as unbounce.com
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Estimales sales
<p>&nbsp;</p>

size of audience * $ per fan based on engagement level = potential revenue
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Fox also suggests building a "Portfolio of businesses for Multiple Streams of Income". You can pursue new areas on interest while leveraging your existing businesses to support and grow each other. This is also a way of reducing risk by diversifying your investments.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Content Publishing Strategies
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The core of your product is your content. Creating good, original content is key to success but can often be difficult, daunting, or tedious. Here are a few strategies to make your content creation easier.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

One way is to take relevant, free content and filtering or synthesizing down it for your audience.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Fox provides a four-week content publishing plan as well. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Week 1 contents (from Page 229)
- Headlines from and links to three of the best industry-related articls available online that week.
- Headlines from and links to the two most interesting press releases form industry companies that week.
- One questions for the audience asking for their comments and opinions on an industry issue

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Week 2 contents (from Page 229)

<p>&nbsp;</p>


The Secrets of Online Advertising
<p>&nbsp;</p>

How to find Advertisers and Sponsors:
- Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Advertising, like AdSense. Every time a user clicks, you get paid a few cents to a few dollars. You add this to your sites by using some auto-generated code to your website. The code doesn't work in emails, podcasts, or videos.
- Affiliate Program Advertising: you get paid when a user buys a product using a link that you provide them. You are provided with code or a link to share from an affiliate program of your choice. These sites include Commission Junction, LinkShare, ShareASale, Amazon Associates or Site Build It.
- Direct Advertising and Custom Sponsorships. Vendors pay you to encourage their brand. This works well in all digital formats.
- Own your products. You get all of the profits from your products once sold.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

- Overcome your past, the future is where potential lies.
- Overcome greed in order to make a real, sustainable business.
- Don't wait for approval: you're the boss, assign your own value to what you do
- Find support before: you're not going it alone or the first to start something new. Find a community of support online
- Failure is the only way towards success. Failure is an option. Pivoting is more important than perseverance sometimes.
- Think projects, not company: this allows for flexibility and dynamic growth as you hire people you need temporarily, rather than long term.
- Avoid gurus and hype that erode your time and money. Look into people and their experience.
- Avoid envy by celebrating others and yourself
- Helping people will get you far. It's kind and it builds trust.
- Business can help you achieve purpose and happiness.
- Take action today. Waiting poses no advantages
- Your life is a limited time offer that only you can use. You're going to die soon, so make life worth living.
